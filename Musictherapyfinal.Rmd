#Rock is the most preferred genre throughout for all the problem. A study reveals that the genre of music that has the most suicides is rock music. This is likely because rock music often deals with dark and depressing topics, such as death, loss, and betrayal. Rock music can also be very aggressive and angsty, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and despair.

#As can be seen from the graph, there is a perfect linear relationship between the the age and the time dedicated to music. As age increases, the time contributed to listening to music decreases.

#5. Is there a relation between an individual being an instrumentalist and them listening to music?

#It doesn't matter whether an individual is an instrumentalist or not, the hours dedicated to listening to music is evenly psread between the two categories.

#6.Which age group suppers from mental issues the most?
G1=ggplot(data = md5, aes(x = Age, y = Depression)) + geom_smooth(colour = "purple") +

  labs(title = "Age distribition OCD")
grid.arrange(G1,G2,G3,G4)

#On an average, people between the age group 20-40 face greater mental issues as compared to other age groups. This is probably because this the prime time of an individual's life when they become responsible and step out into a more competitive world. Greater challenges often create mental stress and other related issues.
